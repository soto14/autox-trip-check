autox-trip-check

#About

An application that monitors the finish line at an autox event to signal when a car has crossed the finish line. 

It will use OpenCV to analyze the images captured by a camera at the finish line of an autox event, and send a signal when it detects a car.

The goal of this project is to try and help local autox communities reduce the number of false timing trips due to debris, humans, birds, etc passing through the timing lights.
